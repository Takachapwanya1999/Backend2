# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Entry Point
**Problem**: Render was looking for `server.js` but the actual server file was `server/index.js`
**Solution**: Created `server.js` in the root directory that properly imports and runs the server

### 2. Node.js Version Warning
**Problem**: Using Node.js 18.x which has reached end-of-life
**Solution**: Updated to Node.js 20.x in package.json engines

### 3. Module Path Issues
**Problem**: Server couldn't find modules due to incorrect paths
**Solution**: Created proper server.js that handles ES modules and correct import paths

### 4. Environment Configuration
**Problem**: Environment variables not properly configured for production
**Solution**: 
- Created production .env file in root
- Updated environment variables for production URLs
- Set NODE_ENV to production

### 5. Build Process
**Problem**: Build process not properly configured for Render
**Solution**: 
- Updated render.yaml with correct build and start commands
- Created build.sh script for proper dependency installation
- Added all server dependencies to root package.json

## Key Changes Made

1. **Created `server.js`** - Production entry point that properly starts the server
2. **Updated `package.json`** - Added server dependencies and fixed Node.js version
3. **Updated `render.yaml`** - Fixed build and start commands
4. **Created production `.env`** - Proper environment configuration
5. **Added `build.sh`** - Build script for Render deployment

## Deployment Status
✅ All files committed and pushed to GitHub
✅ Ready for Render deployment

## Next Steps
1. Trigger a new deployment on Render
2. Monitor the build logs to ensure successful deployment
3. Test the deployed application

The deployment should now work correctly!
